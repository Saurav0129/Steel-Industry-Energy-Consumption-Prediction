## Overview
The Energy Consumption Predictor project focuses on developing a predictive model that accurately forecasts energy consumption based on historical data and relevant input features. By analyzing factors such as reactive power, CO2 emissions, power factor, and time-based patterns, the model aims to provide insights and support decision-making related to energy management.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing historical energy consumption records. The dataset includes information on various input parameters such as reactive power, CO2 emissions, power factor, and time-related features. The dataset is preprocessed and used for training and evaluating the predictive model.

## Installation
To use the Energy Consumption Predictor project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `it clone https://github.com/your-username/energy-consumption-predictor.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
2. Run the main script or notebook to train the predictive model.
3. After training, the model can be used to make predictions on new data or evaluate its performance on a test dataset.

## Results
The predictive model achieves a certain level of accuracy in forecasting energy consumption based on the input parameters. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, or R-squared value. The results obtained from the model can be used to gain insights into energy usage patterns and support decision-making related to energy management.

## Future Work
There are several potential areas for future enhancement and expansion of the Energy Consumption Predictor project:
- Incorporate additional input features to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictive model.
- Explore advanced machine learning algorithms or techniques to enhance the model's performance.
- Develop a user-friendly interface or application to facilitate easy interaction with the predictive model.
- Integrate real-time data sources to provide up-to-date energy consumption predictions.
- Conduct further analysis and research to uncover additional insights and correlations in the energy consumption patterns.
